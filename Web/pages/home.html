    <p>
        Guitar tabs and chords optimized for printing on one side of A4 (aka letter) paper.
</div>
<p>
    What's so great about that? Well:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Great for singalongs and jams - you don't need to turn the page halfway through a song</li>
    <li>All our tabs have ALL the lyrics for the songs - again, great for singalongs</li>
    <li>More readable (vs printing in 2-up mode)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Our tabs are also good for viewing on an ebook reader like a Kindle.
</p>
<p>
    To print, all you need to do is just go File -> Print in your browser and the tabs should print nicely without any headings or guff.
